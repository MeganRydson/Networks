                        <b>Katsushika Hokusai</b> (c. October 31, 1760 – May 10, 1849) was a Japanese artist, 
                        ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the Edo period. Born in Edo (now Tokyo), 
                        Hokusai is best known as author of the woodblock print series 
                        <i>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</i> (<i>Fugaku Sanjūroku-kei</i>, c. 1831),
                        which includes the internationally iconic print, <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        Hokusai created the <i>Thirty-Six Views</i> both as a response to a domestic
                        travel boom and as part of a personal obsession with Mount Fuji. It was
                        this series, specifically <i>The Great Wave</i> print and <i>Fine Wind, Clear Morning</i>,
                        that secured Hokusai’s fame both in Japan and overseas. As historian Richard
                        Lane concludes, "Indeed, if there is one work that made Hokusai's name, both
                        in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series". While Hokusai's
                        work prior to this series is certainly important, it was not until this series
                        that he gained broad recognition.

                        "Under a wave off Kanagawa"), also known as <i>The Great Wave</i> or simply
                        <i>The Wave</i>, is a woodblock print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai.
                        It was published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edo period
                        as the first print in Hokusai's series <i>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</i>.
                        It is Hokusai's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable works of
                        Japanese art in the world.

                        The image depicts an enormous wave threatening boats off the coast of the
                        town of Kanagawa (the present-day city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture).
                        While sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is more likely to be a
                        large rogue wave. As in many of the prints in the series, it depicts the
                        area around Mount Fuji under particular conditions, and the mountain itself
                        appears in the background.

                        <b>Fine Wind, Clear Sky</b> This print and Hokusai's other masterpiece from his <i>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</i>
                        series, <i>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</i>, are perhaps the most widely recognized
                        pieces of Japanese art in the world. Both are superb examples of the
                        Japanese art of ukiyo-e, "pictures of the floating world". Although ukiyo-e can
                        depict anything from contemporary city life to classical literature, and Hokusai's 
                        notebooks show that his own interests spanned an equally wide range, it was
                        landscapes like this that earned him his fame. The saturated colors and stylized
                        forms in such prints helped inspire the Impressionist and Post-impressionist
                        movements decades later.
